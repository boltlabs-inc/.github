## Welcome to Bolt Labs!

At [Bolt Labs](https://boltlabs.tech), our mission is to build usable, secure, and scalable infrastructure to enable everyone to securely store their assets while preserving the privacy of their transactions.

To achieve this mission, we are building [Lock-Keeper](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/key-mgmt): a secure digital asset manager and specialized key management system that helps people store, retrieve, and use the private keys associated with their digital assets. Weâ€™re building a security-first system with layers of cryptography, hardware protection, and a misuse-resistant design.

Our products build on the following open-source repositories:
* [Key Management Specification for Lock Keeper](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/key-mgmt-spec)
* [Threshold Signature Schemes for ECDSA](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/tss-ecdsa)

## Previous R&D ##
**zkChannels**: a scalable and usable privacy-preserving payment channel infrastructure that integrates with existing payment networks, including but not limited to public blockchains. We believe zkChannels can set a new standard for secure payments in online services, giving merchants a seamless way to comply with emerging privacy regulations and delight their customers with cryptographically rigorous respect for their privacy.

* [multi-sig smart contract for Tezos compatible with zkChannels](https://github.com/boltlabs-inc/tezos-contract)
