## Welcome to Bolt Labs!


**At [Bolt](https://boltlabs.tech), our mission is to build a usable, secure, and scalable infrastructure to enable everyone to securely store their assets while preserving the privacy of their transactions**. 
We have been working on two core initiatives to achieve this mission:

(1) **A secure digital asset manager**: a specialized key management system that helps people store, retrieve, and use the private keys associated with their digital assets. We're building a security-first system with layers of cryptography, hardware protection, and a misuse-resistant design.

(2) **zkChannels**: a scalable and usable privacy-preserving payment infrastructure that integrates with existing payment networks, including but not limited to public blockchains. We believe zkChannels will set a new standard for secure payments in online services, giving merchants a seamless way to comply with emerging privacy regulations and delight their customers with cryptographically rigorous respect for their privacy.
